# Mistype

**Simple CSS framework. Grid. Type. Utility.**

Mistype is a set of tools that helps you to design new site. It's a simple
prototyping framework.

## Components

* **Scaffolding** — basic element styles
* **Grid** — mobile-first container, row and column styles
* **Utilities** — float and display utilities, including clearfix

I recommend to combine Mistype with
[Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css). There is also
[a modernized rebase](https://github.com/ZDroid/sanitize.css).

## Documentation
